        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p>
            A chicken nugget is a food product 
            consisting of a small piece of 
            deboned chicken meat that is 
            breaded or battered, then 
            deep-fried or baked. Developed 
            in the 1950s by finding a way to 
            make a coating adhere, chicken 
            nuggets have become a very popular 
            fast food restaurant item, and are 
            widely sold frozen for home use.

        <ul>
            <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cut chicken breasts into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Mix the bread crumbs, Parmesan, basil, thyme, and salt together well in a medium bowl. Put melted butter in a bowl or dish for dipping.</li>
            <li>Dip chicken pieces into the melted butter first, then coat with the bread crumb mixture. Place the well-coated chicken nuggets on a lightly greased cookie sheet in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Bake nuggets in the preheated oven until browned and chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
