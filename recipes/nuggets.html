        <h1>Nuggets</h1>
        <p>
            A chicken nugget is a food product 
            consisting of a small piece of 
            deboned chicken meat that is 
            breaded or battered, then 
            deep-fried or baked. Developed 
            in the 1950s by finding a way to 
            make a coating adhere, chicken 
            nuggets have become a very popular 
            fast food restaurant item, and are 
            widely sold frozen for home use.
