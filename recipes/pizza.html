        <h1>Pizza</h1>
        <p>
            Pizza, dish of Italian origin 
            consisting of a flattened disk of 
            bread dough topped with some 
            combination of olive oil, oregano, 
            tomato, olives, mozzarella or other 
            cheese, and many other ingredients, 
            baked quickly—usually, in a 
            commercial setting, using a 
            wood-fired oven heated to a 
            very high temperature—and served hot.
