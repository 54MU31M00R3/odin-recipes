        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Sushi is a Japanese dish that features 
            medium-grained rice cooked in vinegar, 
            served with raw or cooked seafood and a 
            variety of toppings or fillings. 
            Contrary to popular belief, 
            rice is the main component of sushi, 
            not raw fish. You are probably 
            familiar with the sight of rolled sushi 
            sliced into perfect bite-sized pieces, 
            but not all sushi is rolled.
